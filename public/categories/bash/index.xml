      <description>Taking in options from command line is an essential step towards generalized usage of scripts. However, it is a chapter I skipped in almost all language textbooks since my primary goal was to code for a specific problem and did not mind re-writing the scripts in different situations.
Usually the options following the scripts have two types
 direct inputs (with default definition within the script). the “true”&amp;quot; options with “-” or “–” to allow optional manipulation  For the second type of options, it becomes a little bit complicated.</description>

      <description>Recently I have actively participated two team projects (PAWS and 2020datahack) which involves multiple team members and a lot of group decisions. For the first time, I realized how important to use github as the platform for code sharing and communication. Here I am going to share several commands that I frequently used at this process and hope it will help people quickly pick up this useful collaboration tool.</description>
