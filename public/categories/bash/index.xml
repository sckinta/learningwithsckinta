      <description>Recently I have actively participated two team projects (PAWS and 2020datahack) which involves multiple team members and a lot of group decisions. For the first time, I realized how important to use github as the platform for code sharing and communication. Here I am going to share several commands that I frequently used at this process and hope it will help people quickly pick up this useful collaboration tool.</description>
