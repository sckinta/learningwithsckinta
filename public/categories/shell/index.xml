      <description>Taking in options from command line is an essential step towards generalized usage of scripts. However, it is a chapter I skipped in almost all language textbooks since my primary goal was to code for a specific problem and did not mind re-writing the scripts in different situations.
Usually the options following the scripts have two types
 direct inputs (with default definition within the script). the “true”&amp;quot; options with “-” or “–” to allow optional manipulation  For the second type of options, it becomes a little bit complicated.</description>
