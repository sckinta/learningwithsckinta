      <description>dplyr and tidyr have totally changed the way we code in R. I particularly love the pipe %&amp;gt;% which comes from magrittr package and makes the code easy to read and understand. While I am obessed with simplicity of dplyr coding style, I am also fascinated with how fast data.table wrangles data. Below is an example showing the speed difference using dplyr and data.table in a user function gene_lookup for one of my shiny app.</description>

      <description>Data wrangling usually stands as the first step for any data scientist. I started to learn data science by reading the book “R for Data Science”. The book is mainly an intro to the tidyverse, which is a collection of R packages designed for data science. It has its own grammar/syntax that can help users efficiently deal with data wrangling, visualization, string/date management, etc. As a regular tidyverse user now, I benefit a lot from the transition from base R to higher level R language in sophisticated packages.</description>
