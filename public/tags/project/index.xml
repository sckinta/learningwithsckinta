      <description>As my new year resolution, I decide to participate in more projects and horn programming skills by doing the work. One opportunity poped up at beginning this year. I am thrilled to participate and lead Rladies Phillyâ€™s new collaboration with Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) to analyze their animal data, aiming to help PAWS improving adoption process and clinic efficiency. This blog is part of explortory data analysis (EDA) I have done so far.</description>
