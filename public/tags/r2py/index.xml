      <description>Data wrangling usually stands as the first step for any data scientist. I started to learn data science by reading the book “R for Data Science”. The book is mainly an intro to the tidyverse, which is a collection of R packages designed for data science. It has its own grammar/syntax that can help users efficiently deal with data wrangling, visualization, string/date management, etc. As a regular tidyverse user now, I benefit a lot from the transition from base R to higher level R language in sophisticated packages.</description>
