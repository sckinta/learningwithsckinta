      <description>As a DS beginner, I first came across ML in R by studying the book Hands-On Machine Learning with R. The book mainly focuses on the package caret with general introductions to packages like recipe and h2o. Most examples use the workflow in which feature engineering is performed by recipe and the modeling/learning part is done using caret.
It was a great pleasure to take the tidymodels workshop hosted by Dr.</description>
