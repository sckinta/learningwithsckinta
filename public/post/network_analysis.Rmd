Network analysis is to study the complexity of the inter-relationships between actors of all sorts and provides an architechural view of individual actor connections. It can be applied to many fields, like computer science, linguistics, social science, and biology, and useful for any systematic studies on individual relationship. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)

This post plus a few following posts aim to introduce the basic terminology and R packages that are useful for network analysis and visualization.

## Glossaries
**Vertex** is the node of network  
**Edge** represents the connection of notes, sometimes called "linked". The edge can be **directed** or **undirected**, depending on whether the distinction between source and target is meaningful.  
**Graph** constitutes of vertices and edges, and represents the whole inter-relationship of allnodes. The **subgraph**, from the other hand, represents the inter-relationship of a subset of nodes.  
**Clique** is a fully connected subgraph of a graph in which the every vertex connects with every other vertex.  
**Degree** for a given vertex is the number of adajant vertices.  
**Order** of a graph means the number of vertices. It measures how far away from one vertex to another. Order 0 is always v itself, Order 1 is v plus its immediate neighbors, Order 2 is order 1 plus the immediate neighbors of the vertices in order 1, etc.  
**Attribute** is associated with either vertex or edge. By default, the `name` is the mandatory atrribute for vertex and edge. If the edge has a magnitude attribute, the graph is considered **weighted**.  
**Bipartite network** is two-mode graph, in which there are two types of vertex/nodes and  connections are *only* allowed between different types of nodes. Thus, `type` is a mandatory vertex attribute for bipartite networks. **Affilication network** is special type of bipartite network, in which two types of vertex are known as *"individual"* and *"groups"* while the *"indiviudual"* are members of *"group"*.

## Create a graph
There are many ways to create graph from scratch. Here shows four most common ways to create graph using `igraph` package.

### From edge list 
The example below generates a directed graph from a list of vertex pair (edge)
```{r edgelist, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(igraph)
edge_list = data.frame(from = c(1, 2, 2, 3, 4), to = c(2, 3, 4, 2, 1))
edge_list
m = as.matrix(edge_list)
g = graph_from_edgelist(m,directed = TRUE)
g
plot(g)
```

If the edge is given in a single vector, the default `make_graph` will use the order of vector to make one-mode graph. It means that the first edge points from the first element to the second, the second edge from the third to the fourth, etc.
```{r make_graph_from_edgeVector}
g = make_graph(letters[1:10], directed = T)
g
plot(g)
```

### From adjacent matrix
Adjacent matrix is a square matrix in which nodes are matrix colname/rowname, and the values represent indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph.

```{r adjacentMatrix}
set.seed(123)
adj_matrix = matrix(sample(0:1, 100, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.8,0.1)), nc=10)
adj_matrix
g = graph_from_adjacency_matrix(adj_matrix, mode = "undirected", weighted = NULL)
g
plot(g)
```

There are other modes available with details at https://igraph.org/r/doc/graph_from_adjacency_matrix.html

### From data.frame
The graph generated from data.frame can add all attributes at once. Here is the example from official website. The attributes for vertices (actors) are `age` and `gender`, and edge (relationship) attributes include same.dept, friendship and advice

```{r graphDataFrame}
actors <- data.frame(
  name=c("Alice", "Bob", "Cecil", "David","Esmeralda"),
  age=c(48,33,45,34,21),
  gender=c("F","M","F","M","F"))
relations <- data.frame(
  from=c("Bob", "Cecil", "Cecil", "David","David", "Esmeralda"),
  to=c("Alice", "Bob", "Alice", "Alice", "Bob", "Alice"),
  same.dept=c(FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE),
  friendship=c(4,5,5,2,1,1), 
  advice=c(4,5,5,4,2,3)
  )
g <- graph_from_data_frame(relations, directed=TRUE, vertices=actors)
g
plot(g)
```

### Create random graph
Random graph generation is useful when it comes to simulation.  

* `gnp` and `gnm` generate random graph by assumming the same constant probability for every possible edge. The required parameters for `gnp` and `gnm` are 
    + `gnp` --- the number of nodes/vertex and the constant probability
    + `gnm` --- the number of nodes/vertex and the number of edges

```{r gnp}
# sample 10 vertex, every possible edge is created with the same constant probability 0.3
set.seed(12)
g <- sample_gnp(10, 0.3)
g
plot(g)

# sample 10 vertex, create a 15-edge graph
set.seed(123)
g <- sample_gnm(10, 15)
g
plot(g)
```

* Random **scale free network**, which means a network whose degree of nodes distribution follows a power law. `sample_pa` generates scale-free graphs according to the Barabasi-Albert model. It starts with a single vertex and no edges in the first time step, then adds one vertex in each time step. The new vertex initiates some edges to old vertices. The probability that an old vertex is chosen is given by  $p_i = k_i*power+zero.appeal$.

```{r BA_random}
set.seed(123)
g <- sample_pa(100, power = 2)
plot(g, vertex.label= NA, edge.arrow.size=0.02,vertex.size = 0.5)

plot(density(degree_distribution(g)))
```

## Extract vertex and edge and their attributes
### vertex
To get vertex list and their attributes from graph object, we use `V(graph)$"attribute_name"` to convert graph object to vector.  

```{r, echo=F}
actors <- data.frame(
  name=c("Alice", "Bob", "Cecil", "David","Esmeralda"),
  age=c(48,33,45,34,21),
  gender=c("F","M","F","M","F"))
relations <- data.frame(
  from=c("Alice", "Bob", "Cecil", "David","David", "Esmeralda"),
  to=c("Bob", "David", "Alice", "Alice", "Bob", "Alice"),
  same.dept=c(FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE),
  friendship=c(4,5,5,2,1,1), 
  advice=c(4,5,5,4,2,3)
  )
g <- graph_from_data_frame(relations, directed=TRUE, vertices=actors)
```
```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
# get actor node (name), age (attribute 1) and gender (attribute 2)
V(g)$name
V(g)$age
V(g)$gender
```

We can also put all the vertex attributes to a data.frame using `as_data_frame()`
```{r}
as_data_frame(g, what = "vertices")
```

### edges
Similarily, to get edge list and their attributes from graph object, we use `E(graph)$"attribute_name"` to convert graph object to vector. OR using `as_data_frame()` to convert all edges to a data.frame

```{r edge_attr}
# edge attributes
E(g)$same.dept
E(g)$friendship

# edge data.frame
as_data_frame(g, what = "edges")
```

## summarize graph statistics
### Degree and strength
**Degree** is a very important graph statistics when it comes to network analysis. For a given node(s) to get its degree, we use `degree`. Be aware that, for directed graph, the node degree can be in-degree (the edge number pointing to the node) and out-degree (the edge number pointing from node). We can also summarise the all degree by using `degree_distribution`.

```{r degree}
# get degree for node "Alice" and "Bob"
degree(g, v=c("Alice","Bob"))
degree(g, v=c("Alice","Bob"), mode = "out")

# get degree and degree distribution for the whole graph
degree(g, v=V(g))
degree_distribution(g) # probability for degree 0,1,2,3,4
```

`strength` is weigthed version of `degree`,  by summing up the edge weights of the adjacent edges for each vertex. 

### Distance
`distances` measures the edge number from one node to another. For directed graph, `in` mode only follow the paths toward the first node, while `out` mode goes away from the first node. If no connection can be made, `Inf` will be return. 

```{r distances}
# count all edges from David to Cecil, regardless of direction
distances(g,v="David", to="Cecil", mode="all")

# difference among different mode 
distances(g,v="David", to="Esmeralda", mode="all")
distances(g,v="David", to="Esmeralda", mode="in")
distances(g,v="David", to="Esmeralda", mode="out")

# pairwise distance table
distances(g, mode="all")

# mean distance measures 
mean_distance(g)
```

The small world phenomenon also known as six degrees of separation. Two individual people on Earth are just six people “distance” from each other.  

You can also specify weight for edges and calculate the distance based on different calculation algorithm for weigth. See details by `help("distances")`.  

### Transitivity
Transitivity measures the probability that the adjacent vertices of a vertex are connected. This is sometimes also called the clustering coefficient, a proxy to determine how well connected the graph is

```{r Transitivity}
# two extreme classes -- full graph and ring graph
g1 = make_full_graph(10)
transitivity(g1)
plot(g1)

g2 = make_ring(10)
transitivity(g2)
plot(g2)
```

There are multiple different types of transitivity can be calculated (weighted or unweigthed). Also, the transitivity can be calcualted locally for a subgraph by specifying vertex ids. See details by `help("transitivity")`
