      <description>I am Chun (Sckinta) and I am currently a bioinformatics scientist at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia. Originally from China, I moved to the U.S. in 2011 and completed my PhD in Biology at the University of Virginia in 2017. Starting as a Perl programmer, I picked up R and Python on my own by taking online courses and local meetup workshops. I enjoy learning new programming skills and believe learning is a life-time mission and practice makes perfect.</description>
